# Specification Quality Checklist: Extract Site-Specific Code from Generic Scraping Engine

**Purpose**: Validate specification completeness and quality before proceeding to planning
**Created**: 2026-04-13
**Feature**: [spec.md](../spec.md)

## Content Quality

- [x] No implementation details (languages, frameworks, APIs)
- [x] Focused on user value and business needs
- [x] Written for non-technical stakeholders
- [x] All mandatory sections completed

## Requirement Completeness

- [x] No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain
- [x] Requirements are testable and unambiguous
- [x] Success criteria are measurable
- [x] Success criteria are technology-agnostic (no implementation details)
- [x] All acceptance scenarios are defined
- [x] Edge cases are identified
- [x] Scope is clearly bounded
- [x] Dependencies and assumptions identified

## Feature Readiness

- [x] All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria

- [x] Feature meets measurable outcomes defined in Success Criteria
- [x] No implementation details leak into specification

## Notes

- Spec includes a comprehensive audit summary table linking violations to SOLID principles
- All 5 user stories are independently testable and prioritized
- FR-011 explicitly requires zero behavioural regression — byte-for-byte output preservation
- SC-005 anchors regression testing to the existing 371 test count
- The audit identified 20 violations; this spec covers all of them across 5 user stories
